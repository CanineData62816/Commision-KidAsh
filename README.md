Once you downloaded everything run `npm install` and put your discord bots token as the value of TOKEN in the .env file, i.e. `TOKEN = <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE>` Additionally you need to change the value of CLIENT_ID in .env to your discord bots client id

After you installed everything you need to run `node deploy-commands.js`
Once that finished you're all set! To turn on the bot run `node .`
